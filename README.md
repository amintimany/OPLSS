# OPLSS

Some code that I'm writing while attending OPLSS'16
([Oregon Programming Languages Summer School](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer16/)).

- SystemF : a small formalization of (-/op/bi)-fibrations which
[Patricia Johann](http://www.cs.appstate.edu/~johannp/) taught there.
